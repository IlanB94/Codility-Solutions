# Codility Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming challenges from Codility. The solutions are written in Python and aim to cover a range of algorithmic problems typically encountered during coding interviews.

## Problem List
- **Brackets.py**: Checks whether the given string of brackets is balanced.
- **CountDiv.py**: Counts how many numbers between `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`.
- **CyclicRotation.py**: Rotates an array by a given number of steps.
- **Distinct.py**: Finds the number of distinct elements in an array.
- **Fish.py**: Solves the fish problem for a given array of fish.
- **FrogRiverOne.py**: Determines the earliest time a frog can cross a river.
- **MaxProductOfThree.py**: Calculates the maximum product of any three integers in an array.
- **Nesting.py**: Validates whether a string has properly nested parentheses.
- **OddOccurrencesInArray.py**: Finds the integer that occurs an odd number of times in an array.
- **PassingCars.py**: Calculates the number of passing cars on a road.
- **PermCheck.py**: Checks if an array is a permutation of numbers.
- **StoneWall.py**: Solves the stone wall problem where you need to find the number of blocks to build a wall.
- **TapeEquilibrium.py**: Finds the minimal difference between the sum of two parts of an array.
- **binaryGap.py**: Finds the longest binary gap in a number's binary representation.
- **fromJump.py**: Solves the problem where a frog can jump `X` or `Y` meters.
- **permMissingElem.py**: Finds the missing element in an array that is a permutation of integers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the Code
You can run any of the solutions by executing the respective Python script. For example:
```bash
python Brackets.py
